## Why I Made This
I built this project to create a beautiful way to showcase my favorite images, from digital art to memorable screenshots. 
It serves as a key portfolio piece to practice my skills in Next.js, database integration with Supabase and GCP, and creating a polished user experience.
Most of the code was generated by Gemini 2.5 pro and carefully reviewed by myself

## Features
✅ Responsive Masonry Layout: Automatically adjusts the number of columns based on screen size.<br>
✅ Infinite Scrolling: Fetches and appends more images as the user scrolls down the page.<br>
✅ Debounced Search: Efficiently searches by tags with a 500ms delay to prevent excessive API calls.<br>
✅ Optimized Images: Leverages the Next.js <Image> component for optimization, lazy loading, and preventing layout shift.<br>
✅ Full-Screen Modal: A beautiful pop-up image viewer on click<br>
